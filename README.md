 The Game of Hog

In Hog, two players alternate turns trying to reach 100 points first. On each turn, the current player chooses some number of dice to roll, up to 10. She scores the sum of the dice outcomes, unless any of the dice come up a 1 (Pig out), in which case she scores only 1 point for the turn.

To spice up the game, we will play with three special rules:

Hog Tied. 
  If the sum of both players' scores ends in a 7 (e.g., 17, 27, 57), then the current player can roll at most 1 dice.

Hog Wild. 
  If the sum of both players' scores is a multiple of 7 (e.g., 14, 21, 35), then the current player rolls 4-sided dice instead of the usual 6-sided dice.

Free Bacon. 
  If a player chooses to roll zero dice, she scores the tens digit of her opponent's score, plus 1. E.g., if the first player has 32 points, the second player can score 4 points by rolling zero dice.
